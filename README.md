# bascimacspoof
Basic Mac spoof for Linux (Debian-based distro).
This was created in Kali Linux, to be exact.
To understand this code, you should understand networking programming in C++.
This program uses Linux sockets, and the spoofer is temporary, and your MAC address will reset after the restart of the device.
This is quite basic and a good code for understanding the hardware interaction.
Use at your own risk.
